# PostOffice-Details
get details of any location's post using their PinCode

This project was made using react js to understand the concept of APIs.

Here i have used the postoffice API to get the details of different regions' delivery post.

1.First of all you need to install nodejs.
2.Then you install node moduled usind **npm install**
3.Later create react app using **npx-create-app <**your project name**> 
(if you have installed before this project then may be this command will give you error so
for that you will need to uninstall create-react-app first and redownload.
4.we have installed all the required modulues now to see app run **npm start**
